Great practice w/ HTML and CSS. And I enjoyed the chance to use animations, but this tutorial is from 2021 and according to MDN "webkitanimation" is deprecated in many browsers, including Chrome.

So I'm gonna stop here; it's been fun trying out this feature, but if it's deprecated I don't want to waste time on it.  

I do love the styling on this project and will hopefully get to implement that I learned here in other projects.
